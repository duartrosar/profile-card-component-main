### Useful resources

- Kevin Powell's [Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/user/KepowOb) and Conquering Responsive Layouts [Course](https://courses.kevinpowell.co/conquering-responsive-layouts)- Pretty much any video Kevin has on responsive layouts and sass.
- I absolutely love these [Sass Guidelines](https://sass-guidelin.es/) written by [Kitty Giraudel](https://kittygiraudel.com/), specially the section on [Architecture](https://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture). It inspired me to be more organized with my projects and create good habits.
